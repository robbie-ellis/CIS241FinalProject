      Hi there!  My name is Robert Ellis, and I am an aspiring full stack developer.
      I’ve always had a deep interest in technology, and have worked closely with
      professionals in various technical fields.  During my time as a game audio
      developer at Game Closure in Mountain View CA, I worked closely with project
      managers, artists, and software engineers developing audio for games that were
      breaking new ground in their use of HTML5 to be cross-platform, and playable
      from within a mobile browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to my work at Game Closure, I worked as a seasonal contractor, developing
      a pilot program in music therapy for an adult oncology clinic in Williamsburg VA.
      The program was a success and is still running today.  I also worked as an Accuracy
      Specialist at Pictometry International, in Rochester, NY, where I assisted in
      verifying the accuracy of geo-referenced aerial image libraries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since my work at Game Closure, I’ve done contractual work creating audio
      assets for various video games, and I’m currently a part-time guitar and electric
      bass instructor at 4/4 School of Music in Bothell, WA.  However my main focus has 
	  been on being a stay-at-home dad, helping to raise my young family, and support my 
	  wife in her career as a post-doctoral candidate at Stanford University, and then an 
	  Assistant Professor at University of Washington.
    </p>
    <p>
      My wife and I have a daughter and son, ages 9, and 5, respectively.  It has been
      an immense privilege and joy to be their father, and to get to spend so much time
      with them.  Now that they are both doing full days in school, I’m looking forward
      to getting to a different kind of work and using the skills I’ve gained along the 
	  way to make an impact as a full stack developer.
    </p>
