    <h2>Learning Web Technologies and Coding</h2>
	<p>Since a young age, I've loved working and playing with computers, 
	and, through my studies at Edmonds College and Coursera, it's been 
	wonderful to dive deep into various coding languages and approaches
	to coding.  Here are a couple sites that continue to be helpful:
	<ul>
	  <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">https://www.w3schools.com/</a></li>
	  <li><a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/" target="_blank">https://www.hackerrank.com/</a></li>
	</ul>
	<hr/>
	
	<h2>Music Technology</h2>
	<p>My other great passion is music and music technology.  I set up my
	first home studio with my dad when I was 14, and continued to study 
	and work in the fields of music production, sound design, and 
	composition.  The first link here is to the online presence of Mix 
	Magazine, a trade magazine that offers lots of knowledge, tips and 
	tricks, and enlightening interviews with professionals in various 
	music fields.  The second link is to a great (and free) recording software
	program called Audacity.  I've often used it just for the wide variety of 
	audio file conversions it can produce.
